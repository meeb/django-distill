# Contributor Code of Conduct

The maintainers of this project will treat everyone equally and fairly
and expect anyone interacting with the project to do the same. Use common
sense, that's about it.

All interactions that are a net positive for the project are encouraged.
Any negative actions or behaviour deemed innapropriate will be ignored
or deleted.

This code of conduct applies to this repository and related GitHub hosted
services as well as emails addressed to the maintainers concerning this
project.

We've never had an issue with conduct or contributor behaviour, however
it appears mandatory to now have a code of conduct and various services
and sites won't stop bugging us about it.

If anything really bad occurs the worst that will happen is we delete
some comments or a few issues.
